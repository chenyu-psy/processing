# Experiment 3

In this experiment, we will compare the paradigms of simultaneous presentation and sequential presentation. We will use the same stimuli as in Experiments 1 and 2, but we will change the presentation approach of the stimuli. In the simultaneous presentation, the memoranda and distractors will be presented at the same time, while in the sequential presentation, they will be presented in random order. We will measure the reaction time and accuracy of the participants in both paradigms.
